         *   - 0: Idle. This is the default state. No points may be added to

         *        at 0v, and the shutter is controlled by the data source.
         *   - 1: Prepared. The buffer will accept points. The output is the
         *        same as in the Idle state.
         *   - 2: Playing. Points are being sent to the output.
